            </p>
            <article class="blog-content">
                <p>Moving into university was a whirlwind of emotions. Excitement, nerves, and curiosity all swirled together as I arrived at my new home for the year. With four suitcases and a backpack in tow, 
                    I stepped into my student accommodation, Astor College. The buzz of other students unpacking and introducing themselves was both intimidating and thrilling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After setting up my room, which I made cozy with decorations from home, I ventured out to meet my flatmates. It was a relief to find everyone just as eager to make friends. 
                    Conversations quickly turned to where everyone was from and what they were studying - a mix of accents and cultures filled the air, reminding me of how diverse UCL is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Freshers' Week was everything I expected and more. From welcome talks to late-night events, every day was packed with opportunities to dive headfirst into university life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The highlight for me was joining societies. I signed up for snowsports, tennis, the film society, and a couple of finance and entrepreneurship groups. Each society had something unique to offer, and their enthusiasm made it hard to say no. 
                    I even found myself chatting about skiing trips and tennis meetups with people I'd just met, which felt surreal but exciting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the most memorable moments was the Freshers' Fair. 
                    Walking through the stalls, I felt like a kid in a candy store, except this time, the treats were new experiences waiting to be had. 
                    Between grabbing freebies and chatting with society members, I realized how much UCL had to offer beyond academics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It wasn't all smooth sailing, though. Balancing social events with settling in was tricky. 
                    There were moments when I felt overwhelmed by the constant activity and the pressure to make the most of every moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also underestimated how tiring it would be to meet so many new people. 
                    Names and faces blurred together, and I quickly learned to embrace asking, “Sorry, what was your name again?” without embarrassment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Freshers' Week taught me a lot about stepping out of my comfort zone. 
                    Whether it was joining a group for karaoke night (despite my terrible singing) or striking up a conversation with someone in the elevator, these little moments built my confidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also learned the importance of taking breaks. 
                    By the middle of the week, I set aside time to recharge - a quiet evening in my room with a cup of tea and a movie worked wonders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that Freshers' Week has come to an end, I feel ready to dive into the rest of the university experience. 
                    I'm excited to explore London, get stuck into my course, and deepen the connections I've started to make.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moving in and Freshers' Week have been a rollercoaster of new beginnings, but if these first few days are anything to go by, I know the rest of the year will be unforgettable.
