            </p>
            <article class="blog-content">
                <p>When I started university, one of my biggest goals was to stay active and prioritize my health. With so many changes happening at once, I knew that keeping fit would not only help me physically but also mentally. From gym sessions to sports tasters, nutrition, and rest, here's how I've been navigating staying fit at university.</p>
                <p>The gym has quickly become a staple in my routine for stress relief and building strength. Whether it's early morning sessions or squeezing in a workout between lectures, it's great to have a space where I can focus on myself. My routine includes a mix of strength training—think overhead presses, squats, and pull days—and cardio to keep things balanced.</p>
                <p>The best part? There's always someone around to spot you or give tips on form, which makes the whole experience less intimidating and more social.</p>
                <p>Joining sports societies was one of the best decisions I made during Freshers' Week. The tennis society has been a fantastic way to combine fitness with fun. Every Wednesday, I've been playing with a great group of people. It's a mix of practice and casual games that push my skills while keeping it lighthearted.</p>
                <p>Skiing was another unexpected highlight. I joined the snowsports society for their dry slope taster sessions, which were both challenging and exhilarating. It's a fantastic workout that engages muscles you don't even realize you're using—and it's been a great way to prepare for any upcoming ski trips with the society.</p>
                <p>Boxing, on the other hand, has been an entirely different kind of challenge. The taster session left me dripping in sweat but also feeling incredibly accomplished. It's fast-paced, intense, and a fantastic way to let off steam after a busy day.</p>
                <p>Fitness isn't just about exercise; it's also about what you put into your body. As a student, I've found that meal prepping is a lifesaver. My go-to breakfast is high in protein and carbs—think oats with Greek yogurt, fruit, and a drizzle of honey. For lunch and dinner, I focus on meals that are simple but nutritious, like grilled chicken, rice, and roasted vegetables.</p>
                <p>Hydration is another area I've been mindful of. I keep a water bottle with me throughout the day, and it's surprising how much of a difference staying hydrated makes in terms of energy and focus.</p>
                <p>It's easy to overlook sleep with the late nights and packed schedules of university life, but I've learned that it's non-negotiable if you want to stay fit. I aim for 7-8 hours of sleep a night, and I've noticed that it directly impacts my performance, whether it's at the gym or on the tennis court.</p>
                <p>To make sure I wind down properly, I've developed a simple evening routine: logging off screens an hour before bed, listening to some calming music, and keeping my room dark and cool.</p>
                <p>Staying fit at university is about finding what works for you and being consistent. Some days, it's a challenging workout; other days, it's a short walk or a stretch session. The key is to keep moving and listen to your body.</p>
                <p>University life can be overwhelming at times, but having fitness as a constant has helped me stay grounded. Whether it's the camaraderie of playing sports or the quiet focus of a gym session, staying active has made this journey so much more rewarding.</p>
                <p>As I settle into my routine, I'm excited to keep exploring new ways to stay fit. There are so many sports and activities I want to try, and I'm looking forward to making progress in the ones I've already started.</p>
                <p>If there's one thing I'd recommend to anyone starting university, it's this: make time for fitness, not just for your body but for your mind. It's worth it.</p>
